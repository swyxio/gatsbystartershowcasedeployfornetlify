CMS-powered content</h4>\n<p>As a content-heavy site, the project would need a CMS. Our choice here was <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>, a tool we’d used successfully on a few other products. We set up three Contentful spaces — for development, QA, and production/staging — with scripts to copy models and content between spaces as needed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-static-site-generation\"><a href=\"#2-static-site-generation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Static site generation</h4>\n<p>We also knew that the site would eventually need to launch in both the US and China. This came with a bunch of unknowns on the China side of things: Could we rely on the same build system and CDN for all locales, or would China require a unique setup to account for server performance discrepancies and possible API restrictions?</p>\n<p>We didn’t know, and we weren’t going to know for some time, because most of these decisions were going to be made by an external vendor. Not wanting to back ourselves into a corner, we decided to use a static site generator. No matter what devops we wound up with, we could bank on compiling static files and putting them <em>somewhere</em>.</p>\n<p>All of this begged the question: “What’s a good static site generator that works with Contentful?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"enter-gatsby\"><a href=\"#enter-gatsby\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enter Gatsby</h3>\n<p>I’d already heard a bit about Gatsby, and as I looked into it further, I noticed a few things that got me really excited:</p>\n<h4 id=\"old-friends\"><a href=\"#old-friends\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Old friends</h4>\n<p>Gatsby is built on React, something our team already knows and likes. We use React (or React Native) for most of our projects at Work &#x26; Co because we love the declarative syntax, lifecycle hooks, and modular architecture. In addition to React, Gatsby is compatible with several modern CSS strategies, including our favorite: CSS Modules.</p>\n<h4 id=\"prefetched-pages-️\"><a href=\"#prefetched-pages-%EF%B8%8F\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prefetched pages ⚡️</h4>\n<p>When we decided to use a static site generator, we assumed we’d be building a classic <em>static site</em>, with each route change requesting brand new HTML from the server. For a small, simple site, we thought this was good enough, but Gatsby gave us one better: pre-fetching, out of the box. This meant that our site would feel like a single page app while still benefiting from the flexibility and improved performance of a static site.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contentful-support\"><a href=\"#contentful-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Contentful support</h4>\n<p>Gatsby’s <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-contentful\"><code class=\"language-text\">using-contentful</code></a> sample project made it very easy to get started with the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-contentful\"><code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-source-contentful</code></a> plugin.

Here, we used a modular CMS strategy, where CMS-driven pages were basically stacks of modules that editors could mix and match.</p>\n<p>I planned to use a similar technique for this project; we would have one core content model, a <code class=\"language-text\">ContentPage</code>, and then other models like <code class=\"language-text\">BodyText</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">SectionTitle</code> that could be stacked as children. A <code class=\"language-text\">ContentPage</code> would link to <code class=\"language-text\">BodyText</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">SectionTitle</code> via a <code class=\"language-text\">modules</code> field and have some other non-modular fields as well, like <code class=\"language-text\">slug</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">headline</code>.</p>\n<p>Here’s a <code class=\"language-text\">modules</code> field on a <code class=\"language-text\">ContentPage</code> currently in use on production:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./modules.png\" alt=\"modules field\"></p>\n<p>Figuring out how to set this up in GraphQL took some trial and error, but we settled on using <a href=\"http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments\">inline fragments</a>.</p>\n<p>The GraphQL looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ContentfulContentPage {\n  headline\n  slug\n  modules {\n    __typename\n    ... on ContentfulBodyText {\n      # fields specific to BodyText\n    }\n    ... on ContentfulSectionTitle {\n      # fields specific to SectionTitle\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>After wiring up this new architecture, integrating new modules became a straightforward task.</p>\n<h4 id=\"schema\"><a href=\"#schema\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Schema</h4>\n<p>We ran into one schematic limitation working with Gatsby that’s helpful to be aware of at the onset of your project:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js\">GraphQL</a> requires all queried fields to be defined in a schema, and Gatsby generates this schema from your site’s existing data. This means, for example, that if you don’t have a <code class=\"language-text\">Carousel</code> content model on your site right now, but you have a GraphQL query checking for it, the site will fail to build.</p>\n<p>The are some really promising discussions on the topic on Github, including an <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/4261\">RFC to refactor Gatsby’s schema generation</a>, but in the meantime, most users are getting around this issue by creating placeholder content on Contentful (or whatever their data source is) to guarantee a fully built-up schema.</p>\n<p>This got the job done in our case, and we augmented the approach by creating a <code class=\"language-text\">DummyContentIndex</code> model on Contentful linking to all placeholder content. (In retrospect, I wish I had picked the a more PC name, like ‘PlaceholderContentIndex` 😉.) Using this approach, we could inform our Contentful scripts to make sure placeholder content was copied to the production environment during deploys, so that new models would not break the build.</p>\n<h3 id=\"netlify\"><a href=\"#netlify\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Netlify</h3>\n<p>While we were getting familiar with our Gatsby/Contentful setup, we also needed to figure out how to build and deploy our work. We found several articles advocating for a Gatsby-Contentful-<a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> stack, and learned it could support a workflow like this one:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./netlify.png\" alt=\"our Netlify setup\"></p>\n<p>Unlike a single page app, which would fetch data from Contentful on the fly, our static site must rebuild anytime an editor publishes new or updated content.

Contentful validation</h4>\n<p>Contentful’s built-in validations could only take us so far, and sometimes we needed to enforce rules (or give recommendations) outside the scope of what Contentful could do. For example, when stacking modules on a page, we consider it a minor validation error for the page to end in a carousel (they look kind of lonely).</p>\n<p>To enforce such validations, we set up a static validator page that runs a report on all of our Contentful articles.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-communicating-site-status\"><a href=\"#3-communicating-site-status\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Communicating site status</h4>\n<p>That same validation page also served as a site status page, containing the time and Github hash of the last build. The build time was particularly important. Since builds happen quite frequently (whenever content is updated), it’s helpful for the team to be able to easily see the time of the last build for a given environment. (We also had Netlify integrated to Slack, but this contained notifications about every branch and was a bit noisy for a less tech-savvy audience.)</p>\n<p>Capturing this information was easy and only took a few additional lines in our <code class=\"language-text\">createPages</code> hook. Netlify exposes a lot of interesting <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables\">environment variables</a> (including some I hope to play with more on a future project, like <code class=\"language-text\">WEBHOOK_TITLE</code>, which can help you deduce the origin of the current build). In order to display these variables on the front end, we needed to rename them to begin with <code class=\"language-text\">GATSBY_</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">exports.createPages = () =&gt; {\n  [&#39;COMMIT_REF&#39;, ‘BRANCH’]].forEach((variableName) =&gt; {\n    // only variables beginning with GATSBY_ are available client-side\n    process.env[`GATSBY_${variableName}`] = process.env[variableName];\n  });\n};</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>After that, we just added one more variable to store the current time:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">process.env.GATSBY_BUILD_TIME = Date.now();</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4 id=\"covering-our-tracks\"><a href=\"#covering-our-tracks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Covering our tracks</h4>\n<p>We filtered out our dev pages in production by adding a simple <code class=\"language-text\">onCreatePage</code> hook to our <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-node</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">exports.onCreatePage = ({ page, boundActionCreators }) =&gt; {\n  if (process.env.GATSBY_ENV === ENV.PRODUCTION) {\n    const { deletePage } = boundActionCreators;\n    if (/^\\/dev\\//.test(page.path)) deletePage(page);\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h3 id=\"staging\"><a href=\"#staging\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Staging</h3>\n<p>A lot of our modules include many different properties coming together to form an intricate design, so it’s important to offer editors a chance to preview their changes before they’re published on production.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contentful-preview-api\"><a href=\"#contentful-preview-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Contentful Preview API</h4>\n<p>We use Contentful’s Preview API, which <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-source-contentful</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-contentful#using-preview-api\">supports</a>, for this purpose.

To support Chinese, we wired up an additional preview link in the format <code class=\"language-text\">mystagingurl.com/cn/123</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Contentful lets you generate preview links for as many model types as you like, but in our case, we only needed to generate preview URLs for our <code class=\"language-text\">ContentPage</code> model.

Our staging environment — like all of our environments — already has all of the pages deployed at their actual paths (eg <code class=\"language-text\">/en/my-parent/my-parent</code>), so why can’t we just point editors there?</p>\n<p>Here’s why: Contentful’s Content Preview dashboard doesn’t give you that kind of flexibility. To get around this, we opted to build special paths just for the staging environment. Here’s how we set it up in <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-node.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// Always create a page at the regular path\ncreatePage({\n  component: contentPageTemplate,\n  context,\n  path: `${language}/${slugs.join(&#39;/&#39;)}/`,\n});\n\n// On staging, recreate the page with a path corresponding to its ID\nif (process.env.GATSBY_ENV === ENV.STAGING) {\n  createPage({\n    component: contentPageTemplate,\n    context,\n    path: `${language}/${id}/`,\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4 id=\"build-times\"><a href=\"#build-times\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Build times</h4>\n<p>So now, we have Contentful’s preview links wired up to display the current entry in the staging environment, with data provided by the preview API.

For ultimate peace of mind, you should be able to move forward using your forked work even if — in the worst case scenario — your PR is never approved.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is something developers do all the time. They push their fork to git and link to it in their project’s <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">“dependencies”: {\n  &quot;some-library&quot;: &quot;git+ssh://git@github.com:workco/some-library.git#cool-feature&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Gatsby, however, uses a monorepo architecture, so pushing up a fork with a change to a specific package is not such a trivial manner; npm and yarn just don’t support it. (If you feel like being depressed, check out the npm thread about <a href=\"https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2974\">supporting github paths to monorepo packages</a>.)</p>\n<p>Our workaround was to create a new repo for the package in question and push the build directly to Github. Here’s how it would work if you were making an update to, say, <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-source-contentful</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your local fork of Gatsby, on the branch with your changes, and run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn watch</code> to compile a built version of your modified package.</li>\n<li>Copy that package to a new directory <code class=\"language-text\">cp -a packages/gatsby-source-contentful path-to-my-repo</code></li>\n<li>Push the contents of this directory to Github and link it in your <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> as usual.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"following-up\"><a href=\"#following-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Following up</h2>\n<p>Overall, our work with Gatsby was an exciting venture into a young, promising library, and I look forward to using it again on future Work &#x26; Co projects.
